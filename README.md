# Travelers-Modeling-Comp
Travelers Modeling Competition. Collaborated with Yue Du [@yoyo-du]( https://github.com/yoyo-du )

Task: You work for InsNova Auto Insurance Company, an Australian company. Your business partner, who is not familiar with statistics at all, would like you to create a rating plan based on the historical auto claim data. Your business partner is concerned about segmentation as well as competitiveness, as there are several other competitors in the market. Gini index is used for model performance evaluation.

After researching various models used in the insurance industry we decided to use the [TDboost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TDboost/TDboost.pdf) in R to fit boosted Tweedie model to predict claim cost. We were selected as finalists based on our model performance and presentation to the business partners to explain the model findings and where that would fit in the business setting.
